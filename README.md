# Neo4j-and-Rails-Photo-Management-app

Quickly built as an example. **This will likely go unfinished.**

The idea is to have a system that can import all images on a hard-drive, connect them to GeoSpatial and TimeTree graphs, allow them to be related and connected to each other, then support a Product type that can have multiple images associated with it. This solves the "iCloud/Photos/Separate Hard drives/Where is the image of that product" problem, and allows for connecting to eCart solutions, Mailchimp, and whatever else has an API.

- First win: Images are grouped together automatically by date and location with a simple query.
- Second win: With a minimal amount of effort, you can see images for any product at a glance.
- Third win: As the system is used, any scraps of information the user adds makes it more useful.
